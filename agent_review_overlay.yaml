# =============================================================================
# AGENT REVIEW OVERLAY SYSTEM
# =============================================================================
#
# When a document triggers an AGENT_GATE, the system does NOT send you
# the full document. Instead, AI:
#
#   1. Extracts ONLY the pages that require your verification
#   2. Applies color-coded highlighting to the specific fields, clauses,
#      and sections you are legally required to review
#   3. Generates a private "Agent Review Copy" — a separate PDF
#   4. Delivers it to your private review folder (agent eyes only)
#
# The original document is NEVER modified. The highlighting only exists
# on the review copy. No client, no other party, no one in the transaction
# ever sees the highlights. After you verify and sign off on the gate,
# the review copy is archived in your private folder.
#
# =============================================================================

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# CORE PRINCIPLES
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

overlay_system:

  principle: "Only show the agent what they need to verify. Nothing more."

  document_handling:
    original_document: "NEVER modified. Stays clean in transaction folder."
    review_copy: "Separate annotated PDF generated per gate. Agent-only."
    storage: "Private agent review folder — not in the shared transaction folder."
    retention: "Archived after gate sign-off. Retained for audit trail."
    visibility: "Agent ONLY. Never shared with clients, other agents, escrow, title, lender, or any third party."

  delivery:
    method: "Pushed to agent's private Google Drive folder + notification email with direct link"
    format: "PDF with annotation overlays (non-destructive — overlays are a separate layer)"
    naming: "{address}_{gate_id}_{document_type}_REVIEW.pdf"
    example: "123_Main_St_GATE-010_RPA_REVIEW.pdf"

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# HIGHLIGHT COLOR CODES
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Each color tells you what TYPE of verification is needed at a glance.

highlight_colors:

  YELLOW:
    meaning: "VERIFY — Confirm this value/field is correct"
    use_for:
      - "Financial figures (price, deposit, loan amount, credits)"
      - "Names and parties"
      - "Property address and APN"
      - "Dates and deadlines"
    example: "Purchase price field highlighted yellow → verify the number is correct"

  ORANGE:
    meaning: "ATTENTION — AI detected a potential issue or anomaly"
    use_for:
      - "Fields where AI extraction confidence is below 95%"
      - "Values that don't match a previous document"
      - "Dates that seem unusual for this transaction"
      - "Terms that deviate from standard CAR language"
    example: "Contingency period highlighted orange → AI noticed it's shorter than typical"

  RED:
    meaning: "CRITICAL — Legal obligation requires your specific attention"
    use_for:
      - "Signature fields that are missing or problematic"
      - "Statutory requirements that must be met"
      - "Clauses that create legal liability"
      - "Blank fields where an answer is legally required"
      - "Contradictions between this document and another document"
    example: "Blank TDS field highlighted red → seller left a required disclosure empty"

  BLUE:
    meaning: "REVIEWABLE — This value changes per contract; verify it matches this deal"
    use_for:
      - "All REVIEWABLE deadline dates"
      - "Contingency periods (days)"
      - "Custom terms or addendum language"
      - "Any field that varies per transaction"
    example: "Investigation contingency '10 days' highlighted blue → confirm this is what was negotiated"

  GREEN:
    meaning: "AI VERIFIED — No issues found; included for your awareness only"
    use_for:
      - "Fields AI validated with high confidence (>95%)"
      - "Cross-document matches confirmed"
      - "Signatures verified present and complete"
    example: "Buyer signature highlighted green → AI confirmed signature present and authentic"
    note: "Green items are included on the review page for context but don't require action"

  PURPLE:
    meaning: "JURISDICTION-SPECIFIC — Local requirement applies here"
    use_for:
      - "Sections triggered by California rules"
      - "Sections triggered by LA or Beverly Hills rules"
      - "Tax calculations affected by local rates"
      - "Compliance items specific to the property's jurisdiction"
    example: "Transfer tax line highlighted purple → Measure ULA applies to this $6M property"

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# MARGIN ANNOTATIONS
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# In addition to highlighting, each flagged item gets a margin note
# explaining WHY you need to verify it.

margin_annotations:

  format:
    position: right_margin
    width: "2 inches"
    font: "9pt, sans-serif"
    background: "Light version of the highlight color"

  content_per_annotation:
    - gate_id: "Which gate this verification belongs to (e.g., GATE-010)"
    - verification_item: "What specifically to verify (e.g., 'Confirm price matches counter offer')"
    - legal_basis: "Brief citation (e.g., 'B&P §10177(d)')"
    - ai_finding: "What AI found (e.g., 'Price: $2,450,000 — matches counter offer #2')"
    - action_needed: "What you need to do (e.g., 'Confirm' or 'Resolve discrepancy')"

  example:
    highlight_color: YELLOW
    field: "Purchase Price: $2,450,000"
    margin_note: |
      GATE-010 | Verify Price
      B&P §10177(d)
      AI: Matches counter offer #2
      → Confirm correct

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# PAGE FILTERING RULES
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# For each gate, AI determines which pages of each document are relevant
# and ONLY includes those pages in the review copy.

page_filtering:

  principle: "If a page has nothing for the agent to verify, it is excluded."

  rules:
    - "Include any page containing a field that requires agent verification (YELLOW, ORANGE, RED, BLUE, PURPLE highlight)"
    - "Include GREEN-only pages only if they provide necessary context for an adjacent flagged page"
    - "Exclude pages with only boilerplate text that has no variable content"
    - "Exclude pages that are entirely standard CAR form language with no fields"
    - "When in doubt, include the page — it's better to show one extra page than miss something"

  page_header:
    description: "Each review page gets a header strip identifying its source"
    format: "Page {n} of {total_review_pages} | Source: {document_name} p.{original_page} | Gate: {gate_id}"
    example: "Page 2 of 5 | Source: RPA p.4 | Gate: GATE-010"

  summary_page:
    description: "Every review copy starts with a summary cover page"
    position: first_page
    contents:
      - gate_name: "e.g., Purchase Agreement Terms Verification"
      - gate_type: "HARD_GATE"
      - legal_basis: "Brief summary of your legal obligation"
      - document_source: "Which document(s) this review covers"
      - total_items_to_verify: "Count of highlighted items requiring action"
      - breakdown_by_color: "e.g., 3 YELLOW (verify), 1 ORANGE (attention), 2 BLUE (reviewable)"
      - items_list: "Numbered list of each item to verify with page reference"
      - sign_off_section: "Checkbox or signature area for agent to confirm verification complete"
