  TRANSACTION COORDINATOR — API SETUP GUIDE
================================================================================

  Which APIs you need, what they cost, and step-by-step how to get them.
  Listed in the order you should set them up.


================================================================================
  1. ANTHROPIC (Claude) — REQUIRED FOR MVP
================================================================================

  What it does:  Reads your purchase agreements and extracts contract terms
                 (parties, price, dates, contingencies) automatically.

  Cost:          ~$0.05–0.15 per PDF extraction (Claude Sonnet)
                 Typical month with 10 transactions: ~$1–2
                 No monthly minimum. Pay only for what you use.

  How to get it:

    1. Go to https://console.anthropic.com
    2. Sign up with email or Google account
    3. Add a payment method (credit card)
    4. Go to API Keys (left sidebar)
    5. Click "Create Key"
    6. Name it "TC" or "Transaction Coordinator"
    7. Copy the key (starts with sk-ant-...)
    8. Paste into your .env file:

         ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-your-key-here

  Notes:
    - New accounts get $5 free credit
    - Set a monthly spending limit under Settings > Limits (recommend $20)
    - Key is secret — never share it or commit it to git


================================================================================
  2. PUSHOVER — RECOMMENDED (Push Notifications)
================================================================================

  What it does:  Sends push notifications to your iPhone/Android when gates
                 need review, deadlines approach, or documents are ready.

  Cost:          $5 one-time per platform (iOS or Android)
                 No monthly fee. No per-message fee.
                 Unlimited notifications forever after the one-time purchase.

  How to get it:

    1. Download "Pushover" app from App Store or Google Play
    2. Create account in the app
    3. Note your User Key (shown on the main screen after login)
    4. Go to https://pushover.net/apps/build
    5. Create an application:
         - Name: "Transaction Coordinator"
         - Type: Script/Shell
         - Description: "RE transaction alerts"
    6. Note the API Token/Key it gives you
    7. Add both to your .env file:

         TC_PUSHOVER_TOKEN=your-app-token
         TC_PUSHOVER_USER=your-user-key

  Test it:       tc push "Test notification"

  Alternative — ntfy (FREE):

    If you don't want to pay $5, ntfy.sh is completely free:

    1. Download "ntfy" app from App Store or Google Play
    2. Pick a topic name (e.g., "my-tc-alerts-xyz123")
       Use something unique — topics are public by default
    3. Subscribe to that topic in the app
    4. Add to .env:

         TC_NTFY_TOPIC=my-tc-alerts-xyz123

    Both can be configured simultaneously — notifications go to both.


================================================================================
  3. GMAIL SMTP — RECOMMENDED (Email from Your Alias)
================================================================================

  What it does:  Sends emails from your email alias (e.g., you@yourbrokerage.com)
                 through Gmail's SMTP server. Used for deadline reminders,
                 gate notifications, and custom emails.

  Cost:          Free (uses your existing Gmail/Google Workspace account)

  How to get it:

    STEP A — Set up your alias in Gmail (if not already done):

      1. Open Gmail on web
      2. Settings (gear icon) > See all settings > Accounts and Import
      3. Under "Send mail as", click "Add another email address"
      4. Enter your alias (e.g., you@yourbrokerage.com)
      5. Follow verification steps (Gmail sends a confirmation code)

    STEP B — Create an App Password:

      1. Go to https://myaccount.google.com/security
      2. Make sure 2-Step Verification is ON (required)
      3. Go to https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
      4. Select app: "Other (Custom name)" > enter "TC"
      5. Click Generate
      6. Copy the 16-character password (format: xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx)
         Remove the spaces when pasting

    STEP C — Add to .env:

         TC_SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
         TC_SMTP_PORT=587
         TC_SMTP_USER=youractual@gmail.com
         TC_SMTP_PASS=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
         TC_SMTP_FROM=you@yourbrokerage.com

    If using Google Workspace instead of personal Gmail, the SMTP_USER
    is your workspace email and SMTP_FROM is your alias.

  Test it:       tc email you@gmail.com "Test subject" "Test body"

  Notes:
    - Gmail SMTP limit: 500 emails/day (personal) or 2000/day (Workspace)
    - More than enough for a TC workflow
    - The App Password is NOT your Gmail password — it's a separate credential


================================================================================
  4. GOOGLE DRIVE API — OPTIONAL (Document Storage Automation)
================================================================================

  What it does:  Automatically creates transaction folder structures,
                 uploads review copies to your private agent folder,
                 and organizes documents by classification.

  Cost:          Free (Google Drive API has no per-call charges)
                 Uses your existing Google Drive storage quota (15 GB free,
                 or whatever your Workspace plan includes)

  How to get it:

    1. Go to https://console.cloud.google.com
    2. Create a new project (name: "Transaction Coordinator")
    3. Enable APIs:
         - Go to APIs & Services > Library
         - Search "Google Drive API" > Enable
         - Search "Gmail API" > Enable (if you want to use API instead of SMTP)
    4. Create OAuth credentials:
         - Go to APIs & Services > Credentials
         - Click "Create Credentials" > OAuth client ID
         - Application type: Desktop app
         - Name: "TC CLI"
         - Download the JSON file
    5. Set up OAuth consent screen:
         - Go to APIs & Services > OAuth consent screen
         - User type: External (or Internal if using Workspace)
         - App name: "Transaction Coordinator"
         - Add scopes: drive.file, gmail.send
         - Add yourself as a test user
    6. Save the credentials JSON file somewhere safe
    7. Add to .env:

         GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_FILE=/path/to/credentials.json
         GOOGLE_TOKEN_FILE=~/.tc/google_token.json

    First run will open a browser for OAuth consent. After that, the
    token auto-refreshes.

  Notes:
    - This is the most complex API setup — defer until core CLI is proven
    - Google Cloud project is free (no billing needed for Drive API)
    - The OAuth consent screen says "unverified app" — that's fine for
      personal use, just click "Advanced" > "Go to TC (unsafe)"


================================================================================
  5. DOCUSIGN eSignature API — OPTIONAL (Signature Validation)
================================================================================

  What it does:  Automatically checks if DocuSign envelopes are properly
                 signed: all signatures present, fields populated, dates
                 logical, no timing anomalies.

  Cost:          Free for up to 100 envelopes/month on developer plan.
                 Production plans start at ~$25/month (DocuSign Personal).
                 You likely already pay for DocuSign through your brokerage.

  How to get it:

    STEP A — Developer sandbox (free, for testing):

      1. Go to https://developers.docusign.com
      2. Create a developer account (free)
      3. Go to Apps and Keys
      4. Note your Integration Key (client ID)
      5. Generate an RSA keypair (or use secret key auth)
      6. Note your API Account ID
      7. Your sandbox base URL: https://demo.docusign.net/restapi

    STEP B — Production access (when ready for real envelopes):

      1. Log into your actual DocuSign account
      2. Go to Settings > Apps and Keys (admin access required)
         If you don't have admin: ask your brokerage's DocuSign admin
      3. Create an app with the same Integration Key
      4. Get your production API Account ID
      5. Submit for "Go Live" review (DocuSign reviews your integration)
         Takes 1-3 business days

    STEP C — Add to .env:

         DOCUSIGN_INTEGRATION_KEY=your-integration-key
         DOCUSIGN_SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
         DOCUSIGN_ACCOUNT_ID=your-account-id
         DOCUSIGN_BASE_URL=https://na4.docusign.net/restapi

    Use demo URL for testing, production URL for real transactions.

  Notes:
    - If your brokerage manages DocuSign, you may need their permission
      to create API integrations
    - The developer sandbox has fake envelopes for testing
    - This is genuinely optional — you already review DocuSign manually,
      the API just automates the completeness checks

  SUMMARY
================================================================================

  API                 Cost                  Priority    Setup Difficulty
  ─────────────────── ───────────────────── ─────────── ─────────────────
  Anthropic (Claude)  ~$1-2/month           REQUIRED    Easy (5 min)
  Pushover            $5 one-time           Recommended Easy (5 min)
  ntfy                Free                  Alternative Easy (2 min)
  Gmail SMTP          Free                  Recommended Easy (10 min)
  Google Drive API    Free                  Optional    Medium (20 min)
  DocuSign API        Free dev / ~$25/mo    Optional    Hard (30+ min)

  Total cost to run MVP:  ~$1-7/month (just Anthropic + optional Pushover)

  Recommended setup order:
    1. Anthropic (needed for extraction — the core feature)
    2. Pushover or ntfy (so you get notified on your phone)
    3. Gmail SMTP (so you can send from your alias)
    4. Google Drive (when you want automated file organization)
    5. DocuSign (when you want automated signature validation)
