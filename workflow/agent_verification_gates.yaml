# =============================================================================
# AGENT VERIFICATION GATES
# =============================================================================
#
# As the licensed agent on these transactions, you carry fiduciary duty,
# DRE obligations, and personal legal liability. These gates represent
# every point where the system STOPS and requires YOUR explicit verification
# before proceeding.
#
# Gate behavior:
#   HARD_GATE  - System halts. Cannot proceed without agent sign-off.
#                No override. No timeout. You MUST verify.
#   SOFT_GATE  - System flags for review. Will remind at escalating intervals
#                (1hr, 4hr, 24hr, 48hr) but will not auto-proceed.
#
# Every gate maps to a specific legal obligation so you know WHY you're
# verifying, not just WHAT.
